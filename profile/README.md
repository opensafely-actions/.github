## Welcome!

[OpenSAFELY][] is a secure analytics platform for electronic health records.
Within the platform, [actions][] are logical units of analytic code.
Some are scripted;
a [scripted][] action is written to solve a problem for one study.
However, others are [reusable][];
a reusable action is written to solve a problem for several studies.
This makes reusable actions ideal for tasks that must be completed by several studies, such as joining cohorts or producing deciles charts.
Here, you will find the reusable actions for the platform.
